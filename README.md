  color: #37352F;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
">

Below you will see a Figma design file. **Your task is to translate this design into a fully functional web page component using HTML, SASS, and Vanilla JavaScript.**

### Things to Focus On üõ†Ô∏è

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that your component is responsive and displays correctly across different devices and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile). Consider both Chrome and Safari browsers. 

- **Functionality**: Implement any necessary interactivity or functionality according to the design. This might include animations and any other interactive elements. (This is especially important since the component you'll build is a slider/carousel.)

- **Technologies**: We are giving you the tools and frameworks to build the component. For the carousel, you will use `Slick`. Slick is already included in the `HTML` file, so there is no need to add any additional dependencies.

- **Code Quality**: Write clean, human-readable, and easily maintainable code. Follow best practices for HTML, SASS, and JavaScript. Use appropriate naming conventions and comments where necessary.
